/**
 * The authenticated business's own subscription management surface.
 *
 * Unlike the super-admin `SubscriptionController` (which operates on an
 * explicit `companies/{company}` path), every endpoint here is scoped to the
 * caller's own company — the SPA never has to thread a company id through the
 * URL and a user can never target another business.
 *
 * Endpoints:
 *
 *   GET    subscription            → current plan, status, trial, usage, features
 *   GET    subscription/plans      → the active plan catalogue (billing values)
 *   GET    subscription/usage      → branch + per-branch employee usage
 *   GET    subscription/features   → feature access for the current plan
 *   POST   subscription/checkout   → open a hosted Stripe Checkout session
 *   POST   subscription/checkout/confirm → activate the local subscription after
 *                                          a paid Stripe Checkout redirect
 *   POST   subscription/upgrade    → switch to a larger / equal plan
 *   POST   subscription/downgrade  → switch to a smaller plan (usage-validated)
 *   POST   subscription/cancel     → cancel the subscription
 *   POST   subscription/resume     → resume a cancelled subscription
 *   POST   subscription/billing-period → change only the billing cycle
 *   POST   subscription/billing-portal → open the Stripe Customer Portal
 *   GET    subscription/payments   → the business's payment history
 *   GET    subscription/invoices   → the business's invoice history (payment rows)
 *
 * The whole self-service billing surface is intentionally registered outside
 * the `company.access` middleware so a locked company can still reach it to
 * reactivate (mirroring how the frontend allows `/subscription` for locked
 * companies). Permissions are enforced per-ability through SubscriptionPolicy,
 * never by route placement.
 *
 * Reads are guarded by `subscription.view`; mutations by `subscription.manage`
 * (both enforced through the existing SubscriptionPolicy). Employees and
 * ordinary branch managers never carry those permissions, so they cannot reach
 * billing mutations. Plan pricing is resolved from the database in the service
 * layer — the backend never trusts a client-supplied price.
